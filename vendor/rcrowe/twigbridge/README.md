# Requirements

TwigBridge >=0.6 requires PHP 5.4+ & Laravel 4.1+.

If you need to support PHP 5.3 or Laravel 4.0 checkout out TwigBridge 0.5.*

# Installation

Add `rcrowe\twigbridge` as a requirement to composer.json:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "rcrowe/twigbridge": "0.6.*"
    }
}
```

Update your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.

Once Composer has installed or updated your packages you need to register TwigBridge with Laravel itself. Open up app/config/app.php and find the providers key towards the bottom and add:

```php
'TwigBridge\ServiceProvider'
```

You can add the TwigBridge Facade, to have easier access to the TwigBridge (or Twig_Environment).

```php
'Twig' => 'TwigBridge\Facade\Twig',
```

```php
Twig::addExtension('TwigBridge\Extension\Loader\Functions');
Twig::render('mytemplate', $data);
```

# Configuration

TwigBridge's configuration file can be extended by creating `app/config/packages/rcrowe/twigbridge/config.php`. You can find the default configuration file at vendor/rcrowe/twigbridge/src/config/config.php.

You can quickly publish a configuration file by running the following Artisan command.

```
$ php artisan config:publish rcrowe/twigbridge
```

# Usage

You call the Twig template like you would any other view:

```php
// Without the file extension
View::make('i_am_twig', [...])
```

TwigBridge also supports views in other packages:

```php
View::make('pagination::simple')
```

The above rules continue when extending another Twig template:

```html
{% extend "parent" %}
{% extend "pagination::parent" %}
```

You can call functions with parameters:

```html
{{ link_to_route('tasks.edit', 'Edit', task.id, {'class': 'btn btn-primary'}) }}
```

And output variables, escaped by default. Use the `raw` filter to skip escaping.

```html
{{ some_var }}
{{ html_var | raw }}
{{ long_var | str_limit(50) }}
```

# Extensions

Sometimes you want to extend / add new functions for use in Twig templates. Add to the `enabled` array in config/extensions.php a list of extensions for Twig to load.

```php
'enabled' => array(
    'TwigBridge\Extensions\Example'
)
```

TwigBridge supports both a string or a closure as a callback, so for example you might implement the [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic) Twig extension as follows:

```php
'enabled' => [
    function($app) {
        $factory = new Assetic\Factory\AssetFactory($app['path'].'/../some/path/');
        $factory->setDebug(false);
        // etc.....
        return new Assetic\Extension\Twig\AsseticExtension($factory);
    }
]
```

TwigBridge comes with the following extensions enabled by default:

- [Twig_Extension_Debug](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/extensions/debug.html)
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Auth
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Config
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Form
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Html
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Input
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Session
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\String
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Translator
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Url
- TwigBridge\Extension\Loader\Facades
- TwigBridge\Extension\Loader\Filters
- TwigBridge\Extension\Loader\Functions

To enable '0.5.x' style Facades, enable the Legacy Facades extension:
- TwigBridge\Extension\Laravel\Legacy\Facades


## FilterLoader and FunctionLoader

These loader extensions exposes Laravel helpers as both Twig functions and filters.

Check out the config/extensions.php file to see a list of defined function / filters. You can also add your own.

## FacadeLoader

The FacadeLoader extension allows you to call any facade you have configured in config/extensions.php. This gives your Twig templates integration with any Laravel class as well as any other classes you alias.

To use the Laravel integration (or indeed any aliased class and method), just add your facades to the config and call them like `URL.to(link)` (instead of `URL::to($link)`)

## Functions/Filters/Variables

The following helpers/filters are added by the default Extensions. They are based on the helpers and/or facades, so should be self explaining.

Functions:
 * asset, action, url, route, secure_url, secure_asset
 * auth_check, auth_guest, auth_user
 * config_get, config_has
 * form_* (All the Form::* methods, snake_cased)
 * html_* (All the Html::* methods, snake_cased)
 * input_get, input_old
 * link_to, link_to_asset, link_to_route, link_to_action
 * session_has, session_get, csrf_token
 * str_* (All the Str::* methods, snake_cased)
 * trans, trans_choice
 * url_* (All the URL::* methods, snake_cased)

Filters:
 * camel_case, snake_case, studly_case
 * str_* (All the Str::* methods, snake_cased)
 * trans, trans_choice

Global variables:
 * app: the Illuminate\Foundation\Application object
 * errors: The $errors MessageBag from the Validator (always available)

# Artisan Commands

TwigBridge offers a command for CLI Interaction.
