# Laravel Note:
# Note: Laravel is designed to protect your application code,
# and local storage by placing only files that are necessarily
# public in the public folder. It is recommended that you either
# set the public folder as your site's documentRoot (also known as a web root)
# or to place the contents of public into your site's root directory
# and place all of Laravel's other files outside the web root.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you have no idea or no possibility to edit server's
# settings (for example at shared hosting) -  This .htaccess file
# will do all work for you.
# Just place it into /root folder of your Laravel powered application
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file works with Laravel 3 and 4
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This .htaccess file is recommended
# to be placed into /root folder of
# your Laravel powered application
